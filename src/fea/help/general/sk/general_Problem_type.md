# Problem type

**Problem type** is a unique identifier of the physical phenomena to be solved.

It is possible to combine multiple different **problem types** (e.g., **Heat transfer** and **Stress analysis** or **In-compressible viscous flow** and **Contaminant dispersion**).

List of supported problem types:

- Contaminant dispersion
- Electro-statics
- Magneto-statics
- In-compressible viscous flow
- Heat transfer in fluids
- Heat transfer
- Radiative heat transfer
- Stress analysis
- Modal analysis
