# Boundary condition

**Boundary condition** is a condition specified at the boundary, where boundary can be any model entity (Point, Line, Surface, Volume).


Boundary conditions are:
- **Problem** specific - Each **Problem type** defines its own set of **boundary conditions**.
- **Explicit** - Exact solution is prescribed at the boundary (e.g., **Temperature** for **Heat transfer**). Bold text in **Boundary conditions** list.
- **Implicit** - Implies a solution at the boundary (e.g., **Heat flux** for **Heat transfer**).


If problem is **transient** (time-dependent) then time dependent values can be assigned to boundary condition.
