# Initial condition

**Initial condition** is a condition specified at the boundary, where boundary can be any model entity (Point, Line, Surface, Volume) and can be seen as a starting point for the solver. For **Steady-state problems**, well chosen **Initial condition** improve solver convergence.

Initial conditions are **Problem** specific where each **Problem type** defines its own set of **initial conditions**.
